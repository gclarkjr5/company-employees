//! # Working with Company Employees
//!
//! `company_employees` is a binary that allows a user (at the CLI) to add numerous amounts of employees
//! to the company, along with what department that employee works in. Additionally, the user can retrieve a
//! sorted list of department/s and the alphabetically sorted employees currently within the department/s. At
//! any point the user can end the operations.
